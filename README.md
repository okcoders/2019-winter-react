# Winter/Spring 2019 - React

In this course we will be learning the tools needed to build modern web apps with react.

## Pre Work

Before we get started with react, there are some features of one of the most recent JavaScript specs we'll be using. 

* [arrow functions](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [classes](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [object literals](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [template strings](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [object and array destructuring](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [default, rest, and spread operators](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [let and const declarations](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)
* [ES Modules](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#arrows)

A brief overview of all of these can be found in [Luke Hoban's ES6 Features guide](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features). There rest of the features on this list are useful, but won't be needed for this course.

**Don't worry if you don't understand something fully, we'll go over it all and use them in class!**
