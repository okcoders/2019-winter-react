# Class 1 - ES6 and an Intro to React

## ES6

A few ES6 features we will need. You can find explanations of each [here](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).

* arrow functions
* classes*
* object literals
* template strings
* object and array destructuring
* default, rest, and spread operators
* `let` and `const` declarations
* ES Modules (`import`/`export`)

## Classes

[Here are the MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes).

For our purposes, we need to know about

* constructor (and new)
* properties
* methods
* super and extension

## Intro to React

### Why React?

* Small learning curve
* We can encapsulate logic, state, and UI in highly composable and reusable components
* Almost everything we do is just JavaScript
* Kitch Sinkâ„¢ not included
* Can be used for more than just the web
  * iOS and Android with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
  * The command line using [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)
* Has the most job postings mentioning it of any of the major frameworks
