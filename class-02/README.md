# Class 2 - State Review, Lifecycle Methods, and HOOKS!

## State

How do we handle component state in React?

* constructor
* this.state
* this.setState

## Lifecycle Methods

Methods for hooking into different events happening with your component

* componentDidMount
* componentWillUnmount
* componentDidUpdate
* Legacy methods - avoid these in your code, you don't need them anymore
    * componentWillMount
    * componentWillUpdate
    * componentWillReceiveProps    

## React Hooks

Or, the new way to do things

* no more class components, only functions!
* useState
* useEffect

if we have time, otherwise we'll go over these next week

* useRef
* useReducer
