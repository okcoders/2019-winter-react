# Class 2 - State Review, Lifecycle Methods, and HOOKS!

## State

How do we handle component state in React?

* constructor
* [this.state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
* [this.setState](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

## Lifecycle Methods

Methods for hooking into different events happening with your component

* [componentDidMount](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
* [componentWillUnmount](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
* [componentDidUpdate](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)
* Legacy methods - avoid these in your code, you don't need them anymore
    * componentWillMount
    * componentWillUpdate
    * componentWillReceiveProps    

## React Hooks

Or, the new way to do things

* no more class components, only functions!
* [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
* [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
* [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)
* [useRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)
* [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
